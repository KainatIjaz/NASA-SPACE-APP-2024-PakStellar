# 🌍 **NASA Space Apps 2024 - GIS Mapping Challenge** 🌍

Welcome to the **PakStellar GIS Mapping Project**, created for the **NASA Space Apps 2024 Hackathon**! This project harnesses the power of **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** to explore critical issues in local communities by mapping and analyzing open data.

## 🚀 **Overview**

A **Geographic Information System (GIS)** allows you to create, manage, analyze, and visualize data to uncover spatial patterns and relationships. By layering open datasets onto maps, new insights emerge—revealing connections between physical geography and the societal issues they influence.

This project aims to address the [specific community issue your project focuses on, e.g., "impacts of air pollution on local water quality," "food accessibility in urban areas," "green spaces in residential zones"] by analyzing **open science data** overlaid onto a **custom-built map**. The objective is to showcase how spatial data can provide unique perspectives and solutions to real-world challenges.

## 🛰️ **Challenge Objective**

The **NASA Space Apps Challenge** encourages participants to use mapping technologies and open data to explore how physical geography shapes community issues. Our project specifically tackles:
- **[Insert Your Community Issue]**: For example, understanding the distribution of green spaces in urban neighborhoods and how they impact air quality, public health, and overall livability.
- **GIS Mapping and Analysis**: Using various open datasets, we analyze and visualize spatial relationships to generate meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ **Project Tools and Technologies**

- **Python & Jupyter Notebook**: For coding, data manipulation, and visualization.
- **GIS Libraries**: To handle geospatial data, including:
  - `Leafmap` / `ipyleaflet` for interactive mapping.
  - `GeoPandas` for geospatial data handling and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` or `Plotly` for visualizing spatial data overlays.
- **Open Data Sources**: We used publicly available datasets (e.g., [specific datasets, e.g., "NASA Earth Observations," "OpenStreetMap data"]) to overlay on the map for insightful analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Creating an interactive map that allows users to explore various layers of data.

## 📌 **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to run `.ipynb` files.
- Required Python packages (use `requirements.txt` or the instructions below).

### **Installation**
1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NASA_Space_Apps_2024.git
    cd NASA_Space_Apps_2024
    ```
2. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Alternatively, manually install key libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install geopandas ipyleaflet leafmap matplotlib
    ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook NASA_SPACE_APP_2024_PakStellar.ipynb
    ```

4. **Run the notebook cells** to generate maps and analyze data layers.

## 🗺️ **Project Features**

1. **Interactive Mapping with GIS**: 
   - Visualize and explore geospatial data overlaid on a map using open datasets.
   - Use different basemaps and layers to compare and contrast geographic features and community issues.

2. **Data Analysis & Visualization**:
   - Overlay various layers of open data to analyze their relationships, such as environmental factors (e.g., pollution, vegetation), infrastructure (e.g., roads, buildings), or demographic information.
   - Generate visual insights through charts, graphs, and heatmaps.

3. **Real-World Issue Exploration**:
   - Present a clear visualization of how physical geography impacts a specific community issue.
   - The map provides an interactive experience for users to understand the spatial dynamics of the topic at hand.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection & Preparation**:
   - Collect and clean open datasets relevant to the community issue being studied.
   - Transform data into a geospatial format using tools like **GeoPandas** for easier mapping.

2. **Map Creation & Layering**:
   - Use **Leafmap** or **ipyleaflet** to build an interactive map centered around your area of interest.
   - Overlay datasets as separate layers (e.g., pollution sources, vegetation areas, infrastructure) to provide a visual exploration tool.

3. **Visualization & Analysis**:
   - Analyze the spatial data to identify trends, correlations, and insights that help understand the community issue in greater depth.
   - Use the map to tell a story and offer potential solutions or areas for further exploration.

## 🔍 **Exploring the Map**

- **Pan, Zoom, and Click**: Interact with the map to view different areas and click on data points for more information.
- **Layer Controls**: Use layer toggles to add or remove specific datasets for analysis.
- **Pop-ups and Tooltips**: Click on map elements to view detailed data and descriptions, such as pollution levels, vegetation coverage, or other attributes.

## 🌐 **Possible Use Cases**

- **Environmental Monitoring**: Analyze the effects of industrial pollution on local water bodies.
- **Urban Planning**: Identify food deserts or green spaces in a city and propose improvements.
- **Disaster Response**: Map flood-prone areas and evaluate the vulnerability of local infrastructure.

## 🏆 **Team & Contributions**
